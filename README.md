# Movies Extract, Transform and Load Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this poject is to help an employee of Amazing Prime build a dataset of movies to be used in a hackathon they are sponsoring, and update this database on a daily basis.  We extracted the data from 3 sources, wikipedia, Kaggle and MovieLens and first cleaned the data, transforming the required data and merging it all together. Finally we uploaded the dataset into a Postgres SQL database so that hackathon participants can download and use the data.
